## Getting Started as a Dapp Developer
* Head to the [walletconnect](https://github.com/maticnetwork/walletconnect) repository and look under the "Browser Dapp Example" section.

## Getting Started as a Mobile Wallet Developer
* Head to the [walletconnect](https://github.com/maticnetwork/walletconnect) repository and look under the "Mobile Wallet Example" section.
* If you want to support push notifications, run a Push Server on a machine you control or trust to hold your push notification tokens.

## Implementing a Bridge Server, Push Server, or Mobile Client in a new language
* Take a look at the [py-walletconnect-bridge](https://github.com/WalletConnect/py-walletconnect-bridge) repository for a reference implementation of the Bridge Server.
* Take a look at the [py-walletconnect-push](https://github.com/WalletConnect/py-walletconnect-push) repository for a reference implementation of a Push Server.
* In order to simplify and clarify repository naming schemes, we are currently following the convention \<language\>-walletconnect-\<bridge/push/client\> in our repository names (e.g, py-walletconnect-bridge, swift-walletconnect-client, go-walletconnect-push, etc)
