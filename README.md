# WalletConnect v0.7.x

## Introduction

Wallet Connect is a simple solution that enables communication between desktop Dapps and mobile Wallets using a QR Code to establish a session. It's an open protocol and does not require the User to have specific hardware or install any software. The protocol is agnostic to any mobile Wallet that wishes to support it and enables Dapp developers to integrate with several mobile Wallets through a single implementation.

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect protocol has implementations in Javascript for Browser SDK, Wallet SDK, Push Notification Webhook and in Python for the Bridge Server.

To quickly setup for your Dapp or Wallet, go to [Quick Start](quick-start.md)

To read the technical specification of the WalletConnect protocol, go to [Technical Specification](tech-spec.md)

To reference all the Bridge API calls go to [Bridge API](bridge-api.md)
